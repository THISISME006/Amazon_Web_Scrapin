# Amazon_Web_Scraping

  This is a simple Python script that scrapes data from Amazon.com using the Beautiful Soup library. It retrieves the title and price of a product and saves it to a      CSV file with a timestamp of when the data was collected. The script can be easily modified to scrape data from other websites.

## Dependencies
  Python 3.x
  Beautiful Soup 4
  Requests


## Installation

-   Clone the repository to your local machine:

    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Amazon-Web-Scraper.git
  

-   Install the dependencies:
  
    pip install -r requirements.txt


-   Run the script:

    python scraper.py

## Usage

  The script takes a single argument, which is the URL of the product page to scrape. You can modify the URL variable in the script to change the product.

## Output

The script creates a CSV file named AmazonWebScraperDataset.csv in the same directory as the script. The file contains three columns: Title, Price, and Date. The Date column contains the timestamp of when the data was collected.
